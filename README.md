# scripts
Collection of my workflow scripts, put those in a folder that is contained in your environment path variable

* vimprev - script that lets me open vim in buffered mode, thanks to @tomnomnom
* deblober - script to open blob files from .git/object

You are welcome to use any of my scripts at your own peril. None of this comes with warranty and I am not responsible for the things you (or I) break on your system.
